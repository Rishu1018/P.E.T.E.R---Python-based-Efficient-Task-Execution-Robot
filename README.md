how easier it would be to send emails without typing a single word, doing Wikipedia
searches without opening web browsers, and performing many other daily tasks like
playing music with the help of a single voice command. Through this Project, we will

It can send emails on your behalf.
It can play music for you.
It can do Wikipedia searches for you.
